    "text='''NLP  research  dates  back  to  the  late  1940s  with  Machine  translation  (MT)  being  said  to  be  the  first computer-based application related to natural language. It was Weaver and Booth who started one of the earliest MT projects in 1946, on computer translation based on expertise in breaking enemy codes during World War II. However, a general agreement was made that, Weaver’s memorandum of 1949 has brought the  idea  of  MT  to  general  notice  and  had  inspired  many  projects.  Weaver  suggested  using  ideas  from cryptography and  information  theory  for  language translation  [1]; [29].  According  to Liddy  [1] earliest works  in  MT followed  the  basic  view,  that  the  only  difference  between  languages  was  vested  in their vocabularies  and  the  permitted  word  orders.  Hence  systems  which  were  made  from  this  perspective basically used dictionary-lookup (for appropriate words for translation and reordering of the words after translation to  fit  the  word-order rules  of  the target  language).    This  was done  without  considering  the lexical ambiguity inherent in natural language. This generated poor results and  called for researchers to come  up  with a  more  sufficient theory of  language.  It was  the Chomsky’s  1 957  publication  [25]  of  the syntactic structures  which introduced  the  idea  of  generative grammar [25],  which  gave  the linguistic  a better  understanding  of  how  they  could  help  the  machine  translation.  Subsequently,  other  NLP application areas began to emerge, such as speech recognition [1].  Since 1960 there have been some significant developments, both in production of prototype systems and in theoretical issues. This  has  mainly focused on the issue of how to represent  meaning  and  developing computationally tractable solutions  that the then-existing theories of grammar were not able to  produce before 1960.  Examples  are:  Chomsky’s  1965  transformational model of linguistic  [25];  case grammar  of Fillmore [26],  semantic  networks of Quillian  [27], and  conceptual  dependency  theory of  Schank, which explained syntactic anomalies, and provided semantic representations; Formalisms representation which included Wilks’ preference semantics[28] and Kay’s functional grammar; Augmented transition networks of  Woods  which  extended the  power  of  phrase-structure  grammar  by  incorporating  mechanisms  from programming languages [10]'''"
